Descartes differs from [[Francis Bacon]] in that he has a unique notion of man's position with respect to both God and nature. In his early thought, he believed that he could construct a fundamental science on the basis of mathematics. This was to allow for a mathematical representation of all motion so man could truly master nature, an objective that Bacon first laid out. Descartes' project was called into question by the omnipotent God of [[nominalism]], which undermined the certainty of mathematics. This realization led to a spiritual crisis that ended with Descartes' articulation of his principle, "I think, therefore I am". His scientific project is ultimately a resposne to the problem posed by nominalism. (Gillespie, p. 40)

The Cartesian model of science rests on a notion of man as a willing being, modeled on the God of nominalism, and like Him, able to master nature through the exercise of his infinite will. Descartes lays the groundwork for dissatisfaction that poses problems for modernity. The infinite human will constantly strives to master and transcend the body, but at the same time is bodily. It tries to realize its infinite essence by negating the finite, which is impossible. This idealism ultimately faces a temptation to use ever more extreme means of control to achieve its unachievable ends. (Gillespie, p. 40)
