Ibn Taymiyya was a sigificant Hanbali jurist-theologian. Known for his polemical stances, his thought must nonetheless be understood with reference to a broader method andtheological vision. He builds off, albeit in a critical, the thought of [[Ibn Sina]], [[Abu Hamid al-Ghazali]], and [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]].

# Theology

In part, Ibn Taymiyya's purpose in delving into theology is to motivate worship and obedience to God. Ibn Taymiyya portrays God as perpetually active, personal, and intimately involved in human affairs. However, for Ibn Taymiyya, speaking of God correctly is a also practical concern in its own right.

## Perpetual Creation
Ibn Taymiyya has original contributions surrounding the question of [[God's Self-Sufficiency]]. He says that God has been acting and creating from eternity, with also clarifying that everything other than God came into being after it did not exist. He holds that temporal events are the product of an infinite regress of willings within God's essence.

Ibn Taymiyya claims that the one who performs sucessive acts is better than one who has something conjoined to him from eternity. God's perfection requires that he has been acting and creating from eternity. While there is no one thing in the universe that is eternal, the genus of originating events is. The passing away of individual units does not entail the passing away of the entire genus.

## Creation & Command
Ibn Taymiyya provides a typology on creation and command that classifies his archetypal opponents, though he mentions that nobody denied God's foreknowledge in his time:
1. The Majusis, those who deny the determination of God, even if they believe in legislation. There is a distinction made between extremists, who deny God's knowledge of particulars, and moderates, who deny His generality, creation, and power.
2. The Mushrikis, who acknowledge the determination of God, but deny his legislation. They say that *"If God had willed, we would not have given associates, nor would have our fathers, and we would not have forbidden anything against His will"* (Q. 6:148). Their belief in compulsion annuls ethical distinctions and negates human responsibility.
3. The Iblisis, who do not deny either determination or legislation, but regard them as contradictory. They deny God's wise purpose [hikma] and justice [adl] in his commands.
4. The People of Guidance and Success, those who accept determination and legislation. They believe that God is powerful over everything, has knowledge of all, and that it is necessary to follow his commands and prohibitions.

The will [irada] in the Qur'an is of two kinds; a religious, legislative will and an ontological, determinative will [qadari]. An example of the former is *"I did not create the jinn and humankind except that they might worship Me"* (Q. 51:56). This will is linked to God's love and what is beneficial for human beings. The determinative will is seen in *"Whomever God wills to guide, He opens his breast to Islam. Whoever He wills to misguide, he makes his breast narrow and tight as if he were climbing up in the sky"* (Q. 6:125). Whatever occurs or does not occur in reality is due to God's determinative will. This distinction is aimed at [[Abu al-Ma'ali al-Juwayni]] specifically, who conflated love and good pleasure with all that God determines.

God creates things that He hates and loathes for the sake of a wise purpose that He loves and is pleased with. He could have created everyone to be a believer, but has not done so in His wisdom, as it may have led to some end that He would have hated. *"If God had willed, He would have made you one nation; but He leads astray whom He will, and guides whom He will"* (Q. 16:93).

Ibn Taymiyya argues that someone may have a wise purpose in commanding someone to do something but refrain from helping, or that someone may do something he hates out of a love for a desiriable end. Since this is not considered irrational for humans, it is *a fortiori* ascriabable to God by giving the highest similtude.
