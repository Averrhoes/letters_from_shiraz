Hobbes claims that motion is teleologically determined and, unlike nominalists, mechanical as well. Man is moved not by his natural impulses, divine inspiration, or free will, but by a sucession of causal motions. Humans are no different than nature, and human objects will remain in its given motion unless it is contravened by collision with another body. This collision is conflict because it limits motion, and it intantiates as war between men. The purpose of science for Hobbes is to organize the motion of human and non-human bodies to maximize the free motion of human beings. (Gillespie, p. 41)

He denies that humans have free will, and that will is simply the last appetite before action. Man is a creature, rather than a creator, and an impelled object whose desire is to continue on his prescribed course without interference.
