    <p>Francis Bacon is often characterized as the father of modern science. He was a nominalist that rejected the existence of anything other than individual bodies in nature, which perform individual acts.</p>
<p>Bacon was not concerned with what nature is, but rather how nature works. His goal was not theory or speculation but the practical betterment of the human condition. When we understand the properties of particulars, we will be able to bring them together in ways that produce the effects that are desired. He sought to produce a model of nature as the interacting operation of all particulars, and when nature is comprehended in this way, it can produce works that are useful to human life. (Gillespie, p.  38)</p>
<p>Bacon sought to discover the hidden powers through which nature operates in order to master it. He believes man to be a weak being who can only succeed by working with other men to learn nature&rsquo;s laws and turn it to human use. [[Galileo]], [[Descartes]], and [[Thomas Hobbes]] all built off this foundation to develop alternative visions of modern science (Gillespie, p. 39)</p>
