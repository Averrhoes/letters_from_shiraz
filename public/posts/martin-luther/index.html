    <p>As a young man, Luther became a follower of [[William of Ockham]], but was troubled by the impenetrability and arbitrary of the God described in [[nominalism]]. His quest for certainty was tied with struggle against corruption in the church. Luther rejected the redemptive power of works on nominalistic grounds. Since whatever man wills, God also wills, sin could only be remitted through right willing. His answer to indulgences was an answer to the problem of the nominalist God: &ldquo;faith alone saves&rdquo;. (Gillespie, p. 33)</p>
<p>Scripture, which is usually undermined through nominalism, is given a different status by Luther. In his view, it is not only a text, but a means through which God speaks directly to man. Faith comes about by hearing the voice of God. (Gillespie, p. 33)</p>
